OVPN Manager is a comprehensive, self-hosted web panel built with Flask to streamline the management of OpenVPN servers. It provides a modern, user-friendly, and feature-rich interface for managing users, resellers (sub-admins), and even multi-node deployments, turning complex server administration into a simple point-and-click experience.

This panel is designed for administrators who need granular control over user access, traffic, and server resources, all from a centralized and intuitive dashboard.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

The panel is a robust Flask application that acts as the brain of the operation. It interacts with the system to manage users and services.

* **Backend**: **Flask**, **Gevent** (for WSGI), **SQLAlchemy** (for database ORM)
* **Database**: **SQLite**
* **Core Management**: Interacts directly with an `openvpn.sh` script for user provisioning and `systemctl` for service management.
* **Frontend**: **Tailwind CSS**, **Font Awesome**, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Scheduling**: **APScheduler** for background tasks like traffic updates and license checks.

## üöÄ Installation Guide

The installation process is fully automated using a management script.

### *Prerequisites*
* A server running **Ubuntu 22.04 (x86_64)**. The installer will not work on other versions.
* Root (`sudo`) access to the server.

### *Step 1: Run the Installer*
Connect to your server via SSH and run the single command below. This will download the main management script and start the installation menu.

```bash
wget -q -O /root/vpn_manager.sh [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eylandoo/openvpn_webpanel_manager/main/vpn_manager.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eylandoo/openvpn_webpanel_manager/main/vpn_manager.sh) && chmod +x /root/vpn_manager.sh && /root/vpn_manager.sh
```

### *Step 2: Install OpenVPN Core*
After running the command, an interactive menu will appear.

1.  Select the **`Install OpenVPN Core`** option.
2.  You will be prompted to choose a protocol (**UDP** or **TCP**) and a **Port** for your OpenVPN server.
3.  The script will handle the installation automatically.

### *Step 3: Install the Web Panel*
Once the OpenVPN core is installed, you will return to the main menu.

1.  Select the **`Install OpenVPN Web Panel`** option.
2.  The script will ask for the following details:
    * **Admin Username**: The username for logging into the web panel.
    * **Admin Password**: The password for the web panel.
    * **Panel Port**: The port on which the web panel will be accessible.
3.  The installer will then set up all dependencies, download the panel application, and configure the services.

### *Step 4: Access Your Panel*
After the installation is complete, the script will display the access details for your new web panel, including the URL, username, and password.
