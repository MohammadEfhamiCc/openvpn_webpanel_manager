OVPN Manager is a comprehensive, self-hosted web panel built with Flask to streamline the management of OpenVPN servers. It provides a modern, user-friendly, and feature-rich interface for managing users, resellers (sub-admins), and even multi-node deployments, turning complex server administration into a simple point-and-click experience.

This panel is designed for administrators who need granular control over user access, traffic, and server resources, all from a centralized and intuitive dashboard.

### Multi-Node Support
* **Centralized Control**: Manage and sync users across multiple OpenVPN servers (nodes) from a single main panel.
* **Node Health Monitoring**: View the live status of all connected nodes.
* **Selective Access**: Assign specific nodes to users, giving you control over which servers they can connect to.

### Server & Panel Administration

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

The panel is a robust Flask application that acts as the brain of the operation. It interacts with the system to manage users and services.

* **Backend**: **Flask**, **Gevent** (for WSGI), **SQLAlchemy** (for database ORM)
* **Database**: **SQLite**
* **Core Management**: Interacts directly with an `openvpn.sh` script for user provisioning and `systemctl` for service management.
* **Frontend**: **Tailwind CSS**, **Font Awesome**, Vanilla JavaScript
* **Scheduling**: **APScheduler** for background tasks like traffic updates and license checks.
